Directory should contain config files containing GPU settings, with the naming 
convention "<coin>.json".  For example, "eth.json".  The list of acceptable coin
names is currently limited by a check at the top of the setupGPUs.sh file.

Most parameters are defined in a global defaults section, and can be overridden
in the GPU specific sections if necessary.  An example file is provided in this
directory.
